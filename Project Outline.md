# Team 3 - Fab Four Portfolio Optimizers
## Team Members
* Steven Cherry II
* Fred Fu
* James Menacho
* Hamza Parekh

## Project Goal

Use Efficient Market Hypothesis to arrive at optimized portflio for the individual investor.  Calculate and visualize return, risk metrics to arrive at optimmized portfolio and contrasted benchmark portfolio.  Project future portfolio returns throught financial simulation.

## What are we trying to solve for?

1. Can we show a verifiable uplift in our model portflio's sharpe ratio through the optimization process?  

2. Does the notion of asset class diversification have merit?
