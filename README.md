## "Optimized Asset Allocation for the Individual Investor"
 
* Our company's goal is to use Efficient Market Hypothesis to arrive at optimized portflios for the individual investor

**What are we trying to solve for?**

- [X] Can we show a verifiable uplift in our model portflio's sharpe ratio through the optimization process?
- [X] Does the notion of asset class diversification have merit?

## We aim to solve for the Investment Issues of the Bulk of the Investment Public

* In 2019, Forbes reported that 78% of American workers lived paycheck to paycheck [^1]
* Also in 2019, Bankrate reported that just 16% of Americans save more then 15% of their annual earnings - 21% save none [^2] 
* Thus far in 2020, Gallup finds 55% of Americans reporting that they own stock [^3] 
* The concept of Diversification. 50% of Americans don’t know if it’s better to invest in a single stock or a mutual fund [^4] 

### The Notion of the Efficient Frontier in the context of Modern Portfolio Theory

* MPT is based on the thought that investor portfolios can be optimized through diversification. "Portfolio Seection", 1952
* The Efficient Frontier is marked by portfolios that give the highest return for a given level of risk
* Efficient Frontiers will vary based on asset inputs and weightings
* The lowering of covariance between a given portfolio's securities will reduce portfolio standard deviation (risk) 
* Optimized portfolio are plotted on the EF line.
* Portfolios that are diversified tend to be closer to the EF line versus those that are not

### Monte Carlo Simulation
* Computational Algorithms that output numerical results after continual random sampling
* Monte Carlo relies on the concept of randomness to project outcomes that might otherwise be deterministic in principle

### Caveats to Theory/Constructs Used:
* Past Projecting Future Returns
* Data Integrity
* Data look-back/time-line versus Projected Data
* Monthly Rebalancing

* EFM issues:

    * Financial markets rarely fit the assumptions of mean-variance models.  i.e 1970s, 2000s (bond dominance) versus 
    1990s (stock)
    * The EF is thus a "moving target"


* Monte Carlo Issues: 

    * In order to have a robust MC, you need to have the following criteria which can be elusive in some cases:
    
      * There are enough samples to ensure accurate outcomes
      * The algorithm used is valid for what it is being modeled for
      * MC actually simulates the phenomenon in question
